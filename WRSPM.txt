Group 3 Proposal Submission
Group 3: Douglas Bluemel, John Boncukcu, Lochana Subedi, and Daniel Hong

We will be creating a note taking application for students. This application will allow students to add classmates as friends, personalize their profiles and share their notes with each other. It will allow students to either draw their notes or type based on their preference. After they are finished it will allow the user to save, share, and export their work. The aim of this application is to boost communication between students and an easy way for students to take notes.
